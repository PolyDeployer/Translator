Blockchain Translator
This project helps translate Solana smart contracts into Ethereum-compatible Solidity contracts. It also provides tools to validate and deploy the translated contracts.

Features
Converts Solana contracts into Ethereum Solidity format.
Validates the translated contracts for errors.
Supports deployment to an Ethereum test network.
How to Use
Prepare a Solana smart contract and place it in the project folder.
Run the program to translate the Solana contract into Solidity.
Review the translated Solidity contract.
Use the validation tool to check for any issues in the Solidity code.
Optionally, deploy the validated Solidity contract to an Ethereum test network
